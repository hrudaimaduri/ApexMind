EGO THEORY — THE ENGINE OF SELF-TRANSFORMATION

In performance psychology, ego is your competitive identity — the internal force that demands growth and rejects mediocrity.

Healthy ego traits:

Confidence in your abilities

Ambition to surpass your past self

Ownership over your actions

Pride in your progress

Ruthless honesty with weaknesses

When ego is aligned, you become unstoppable. Ego is the voice inside that says:
“I must win. I must improve. I refuse to remain ordinary.”
