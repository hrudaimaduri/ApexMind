DISCIPLINE — THE FOUNDATION OF HIGH PERFORMANCE

Discipline is the ability to do what must be done regardless of mood. Motivation is emotion. Discipline is identity.

Highly disciplined individuals:

Operate from systems, not feelings

Maintain consistency under stress

Break tasks into rituals

Remove distractions

Build habits through repetition

Track progress with data

Act even when tired, scared, or discouraged

True discipline is quiet and relentless. It makes improvement inevitable.
